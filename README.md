This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 in the following paper:

Virginia Bordignon, Vincenzo Matta, and Ali H. Sayed,  "Adaptive social learning,'' in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2021.

Figs. 1 and 2 are generated executing file 'figs1_2.py'.

Fig. 3 is generated executing file 'fig3.py'.

Fig. 4 is generated executing file 'fig4.py'.

Figs. 6-10 are generated executing file 'figs6_7_8_9_10.py'.

Figs. 12 and 13 are generated executing file 'figs12_13.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
